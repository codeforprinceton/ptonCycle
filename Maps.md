This file is for planning/thinking about how to incorporate maps into the app.

Functionality:
- Shows maps of Princeton area with bike relevant aspects:
 - Parking (including amenities such as rain cover)
 - Bike share
 - Informal parking spots
 - Water fountains
- Allow users to quickly map bike relevant aspects
 - Dangers and obstructions on path
 - Non-functional facilities (broken water fountain, full bike rack)
 - Good informal bike parking
- We are not doing navigation, but want it easily accessible at stops. 


Tech stuff:
- An OSM API to d/l some aspects of small regions: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API (read only)
- The general OSM, some subset should be useful for reporting/mapping, use with care! https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6
- Ways to incorporate maps into webpages: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Frameworks#Webmaps

To research:
- Too many webmaps. What is good for us? should allow to select features, work in Android, be quick and power-cheap.
- OSM on Android?
