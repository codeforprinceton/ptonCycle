From Greg at DVRPC:

DVRPC’s processing takes the raw GPS traces and cleans them to create both a neater trace and a route that can be snapped to the open street maps road/trails network. This snapping allows ‘like’ traces to be added together to show total trip volume for an individual facility, link, or trip pattern.
In terms of the traces, really the more data, the better. 

dv: Processing is not fully automated, and done in month sized batches for Philly.
