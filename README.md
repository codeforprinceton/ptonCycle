# ptonCycle

# Goals
- Help cyclers in Princeton make the most of it, especially newcomers!
- Produce planning relevant information to make Princeton even better for cyclers.

# Ideas:
- Baseline is give people easy access to some resources, and allow to report trips to DVRPC.
- Help people decide routes. Common is shortest path; other options are user planning, or suggest spots to pass through.
- Sports/tracking: miles, speed, elevations. Graph'em, upload to existing sites, compare to others.
- Allow reporting of bike relevant stuff:
 - New bike rack, broken bike rack, full bike rack (app shows next nearest)
 - Pothole, car on bike lane or other danger. 
 - Into Access Princeton? API? 
 - Community accessible, mapped DB?
